This repository supports the [Java and AI](https://azure-samples.github.io/java-on-aca/) lab series. In these labs, you'll walk through deploying the sample [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-aca/tree/main/src) application to an [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) environment while also integrating additional Azure services, such as [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview).

Please visit the [**Java and AI lab series documentation**](https://azure-samples.github.io/java-on-aca/) for information on lab requirements, how to prepare your development environment, and instruction on running these labs.
