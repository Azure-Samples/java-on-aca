> The work you did in this lab is fundamental to both this lab and the next several labs youâ€™ll be working through, so please do not delete any of the Azure resources you've created here.

> As we mentioned in the [Install instructions]({% link install.md %}#preparing-your-subscription), you can use both the `saveenv` and `loadenv` commands to manually save and load your environment variables at any time.

>You've done a lot in this lab, so now is a good time to run `saveenv` to make sure your current environment variables will be there if you have to start a new bash session.
